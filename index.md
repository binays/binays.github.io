## Personal Info
Hi! I am Binay Dahal. Currently, I am doing MS in Computer Science in University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My research interest includes Deep Learning, its Applications on Natural Language Processing, Image Analysis, and General AI. I am also interested in Improving the training methods in deep learning models. I mean, its getting us good and profitable results but as Hinton says, "We are getting results does not mean we are doing it correctly."
